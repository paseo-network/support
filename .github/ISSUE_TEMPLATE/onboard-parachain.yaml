        :warning: Paseo weights: Please be mindful that Paseo Network runs with a different hardware than Polkadot. We recommend re-benchmarking your parachain under the corresponding reference hardware (See [PAS-7-Hardware_specs.md]()https://github.com/paseo-network/paseo-action-submission/blob/main/pas/PAS-7-Hardware_specs.md) for avoiding PoV inconsistencies.
